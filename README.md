### About me
Hi! I'm Bruna, an Information Systems student currently in my penultimate semester. I am fascinated by the tech field and its endless possibilities. While I enjoy exploring various areas of technology, I've developed a strong passion for Data Analysis.

I am currently working in my hometown in Minas Gerais, Brazil, while dedicating my studies to reaching my career goals. I’m driven, eager to learn, and working hard to land my dream role in tech!

Thank you for visiting! My profile is still a work in progress, but feel free to look around or connect with me on LinkedIn or Instagram. 
See you soon!
